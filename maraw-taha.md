> - **LIFETIME COMMISSIONS**
>  ability for you to assign customer commissions to your affiliate, even if the customer buys a new computer (tracked without cookies).
>  Functionality of this plugin is based on the fact that you can identify a customer by using unique identification (e.g. by email). After the customer makes his/her first sale, Post Affiliate Pro will create a relation between the customer and the referring affiliate, and all of the sales from that customer will be assigned to the particular affiliate, even if the customer makes the next purchase using another computer. Even if the customer is  referred by any other affiliate on another computer, the commission will be still assigned to the first affiliate, because the Lifetime Commissions has higher priority than any other type of tracking (e.g. Flash cookie, Browser cookie, IP address or similar)
