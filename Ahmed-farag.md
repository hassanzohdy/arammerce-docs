# E-Commerce front-end features


### The main purpose of the front-end website is to look good so as to attract as many visitors as possible. The actual functionality is always quite simple - show the customer what he can buy and encourage him/her to buy it. There will usually be the need to connect to a payment gateway to take the customer's payment, and to communicate with a back-end database, but this communication is usually quite limited - "read products", "add customers", "add orders".

In the very early days all the "purchase" button did on a website was to generate an email. A salesperson from the company would then contact you to arrange payment, either by sending a cheque through the post or by taking your credit card details over the telephone.

What skills does the front-end website require? As it is a web site it requires HTML, plus CSS for styling, Javascript/Ajax for fancy interactions, and lots of sexy graphics plus some Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). There is not much "real" programming involved.

People who call themselves "web developers" may only have a limited set of skills:-

1. Some are nothing more than graphic designers who can produce pretty images. They can show you what they think the website should look like, and describe how it should function, but they cannot actually build anything that works. This means that somebody else has to translate these pretty pictures into working HTML documents and program code.
2. Some can take a design and build a mock-up of the website in HTML but with dummy data instead of real data from a database. They can also incorporate some CSS and perhaps some Javascript to enhance the look and feel of those web pages. Somebody else then has to write the program code which generates each of these HTML documents, and replace the dummy data with calls to the database.
3. Some developers can design the web pages, build the HTML, CSS and Javascript, and write the program code which joins those web pages to the database, but they still rely on a "back-end developer" to design the database(s), write the data access code, implement the business rules, and build the back-end application which maintains the contents of the database(s).
4. Some developers can actually handle both the front end and back end processing, but as each of these ends requires skills which are not relevant in the other, the number of these developers is quite small.
Some non-eCommerce websites make use of pre-written packages which deal with Content Management (CMS) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) which can be either free or low cost. An amazing number of people seem to think that it is a trivial exercise to install one of these packages and extend it to provide both a front-end and back-end eCommerce solution, but attempting to bend a CMS or CRM package to do what it was not designed to do is guaranteed to end up as expensive, inefficient at best or a total failure at worst.
